# 🖐️ Handit - The open-source engine to optimize your LLM agents in production.

No black-box failures. No silent regressions. Just real feedback—and real improvements.

Handit is a **developer-first, open-source platform for optimizing LLM agents** in real-world settings.  
It's designed to help you **track**, **evaluate**, and **continuously improve** the performance of any AI agent you've deployed.

This isn't another wrapper.  
This is the feedback loop your agents have been missing.

## ✨ What Handit Delivers

Handit gives you the tools to observe, evaluate, and improve every part of your LLM agents—node by node.

- �� **Track Everything**  
  Capture all agent activity—inputs, outputs, tool calls, intermediate reasoning—across every node. Gain full visibility into how your agent actually behaves in production.

- 🧠 **Evaluate Automatically**  
  Use LLM-based evaluators to score each output. Assess quality, correctness, hallucination risk, and more at every step in your agent's execution graph.

- 💡 **Generate Insights**  
  Automatically detect failure patterns, drift, or low-performing prompts. Get actionable suggestions tied to specific parts of your agent.

- ✍️ **Version Prompts**  
  Track, compare, and roll back prompt changes. Version control is built into the system—by node, model, or project.

- 🔁 **Route Intelligently**  
  Serve the best prompt version dynamically via A2A-style routing. Optimize execution paths before they even run.

> If your agent is in production, Handit helps make sure it's actually working—and keeps getting better.
