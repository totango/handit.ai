## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 12.x or higher)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for Docker setup)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handit-api.git
   cd handit-api
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file at the root of your project to configure environment variables. (See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables))

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode with live-reloading, use:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server using `nodemon` which watches for file changes.

### Production Mode

To run the application in production mode, use:
```bash
npm start
```

## Database Migrations and Seeding

### Running Migrations

To run migrations using Sequelize CLI:
```bash
npm run migrate
```

### Seeding the Database

To seed the database with initial data:
```bash
npm run seed
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project with the following variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_database_url
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
```

## Docker Support

You can run the application with Docker using the following commands.

### Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image:
```bash
npm run docker-build
```

### Running with Docker Compose

To run the application with Docker Compose:
```bash
npm run docker-start
```

This will start both the application and the PostgreSQL database using the `docker-compose.yml` configuration.
